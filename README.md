**QR Authentication System**
 
**QR** is an abbreviation for **Quick Response**. QR code is a type of two-dimensional barcode that can be easily scanned by a smartphone or other modbile device. It stores information in *square grid* of black dots and white spaces.

**Functionality** - QR can be used to store various types of information including URLs, contact information, texts, payment details.

**Data Capacity** - Compared to barcodes, QR can hold large amount of data. it can store up to 4296 characters of text. 

**Types of QR codes**
**Static**
1. URL QR code
2. vCard QR code
3. SMS QR code 
4. Email QR code

6. App Store QR code

**How QR Codes Works**
**Encoding**: The process begins when the information is converted into a QR code. This information could consist of payment details, URLs, text, or other data. The information is processed using a specific algorithm to create a pattern of black and white squares. Each unique pattern corresponds to different characters or sequences of data.

**Scanning**:
The QR code is scanned using a device equipped with a camera and a QR code reader application, typically a smartphone or tablet. The application uses the camera to photograph the code and then interprets the pattern of black and white squares to convert them back into the original data.

**Data Extraction**:
The scanner decodes the information embedded in the QR code and performs the designated action, such as opening a website, displaying text or automatic login.

Typically, in the context of login, the QR code encodes the user's account credentials and, sometimes, the session token. When the user scans the QR code with their mobile device, the app reads the encoded data, fills in the user credentials automatically, and the user needs only to confirm the authentication.

**Security Concerns**
The QR code, if lost or stolen, could be used by an unauthorized person to log in to the user's account. The QR code should be kept secure in the same way as the user's password. The QR code should be generated using a secure and unpredictable method and protected with a secure key.
